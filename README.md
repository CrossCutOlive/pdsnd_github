### Project Title
Udacity NanoDegree: Post your work on GitHub & Explore US BikeShare Data with Python!

### Description
The project is to learn how to manage and update files while keeping track of edits using Git and GitHub.

This is done while using a previous project for learning how to use Python for data analysis.

This project consists of the bikeshare.py file which is a script written in python for a user to interact through a computer terminal to interrogate and analyze the dataset.

The dataset consists of user bikeshare data from three US cities of Washington, New York City and Chicago.

The script allows the user to select certain parameters when viewing the dataset for example month, city and day of the week. The script also contains some common error handler such as incorrectly keyed entries.

### Files used
Bikeshare.py
chicago.csv
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv
